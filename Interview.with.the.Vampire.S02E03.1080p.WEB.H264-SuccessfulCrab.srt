1
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:28,562
Louis and Claudia, the
Théâtre des Vampires.

2
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:30,507
What about the
others out there?

3
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,133
Giddy to increase
their numbers.

4
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:33,634
The great conversion.

5
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:34,968
 What you're about to see

6
00:00:35,136 --> 00:00:36,670
is for you, an outrage.

7
00:00:36,804 --> 00:00:38,139
You were amazing.

8
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:40,040
Who's your maker?
His name was Brent.

9
00:00:40,174 --> 00:00:41,675
We don't talk about him much.

10
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:43,420
Who's that handsome man
on the wall up there?

11
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:45,513
Our co-founder,
Lestat de Lioncourt.

12
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:47,981
That means you knew
Lestat before he did.

13
00:00:48,116 --> 00:00:50,050
Yes, Armand knew Lestat.

14
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:51,585
You both fucked Lestat.

15
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,097
What if they find
out we killed him?

16
00:00:53,121 --> 00:00:55,323
I want to go back.
It's not safe there.

17
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:57,191
I do believe I felt
some trepidation

18
00:00:57,325 --> 00:00:59,493
when the name Lestat presented.

19
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,671
Who? Armand: We could simply
return to the interview.

20
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:05,032
If you're willing to ask your
questions and then listen,

21
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:06,500
which is your job.

22
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:09,503
What happened next?

23
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,807
Here we go.

24
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:53,881
Oh...

25
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:59,653
Partial to the non-wriggling
items. I should've said that.

26
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,994
The perils of Omakase.

27
00:02:08,296 --> 00:02:10,631
We cede power to the
chef, submit to his whims,

28
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:13,834
to his eye at the fish
market. A series of risks.

29
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:17,404
- Right.
- 'Under the Burning Sky.'

30
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:20,107
The one about Enron,
'Black Blood' was it?

31
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,843
You're Daniel Molloy.
I've read your books.

32
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:26,347
A reader. Well, prepare
yourself for disappointment.

33
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,719
I see they've separated
you from your laptop.

34
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,288
They?

35
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:36,524
Off your game a touch yesterday.

36
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:38,758
Perhaps they believe
you've been humbled.

37
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,828
Clever on their own,
now there's two of them.

38
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:42,863
Of course, there was
always two of them.

39
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:44,532
You just came to that late.

40
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:49,370
Going to stop
looking at you now.

41
00:02:51,472 --> 00:02:53,473
A little pale for Mossad.

42
00:02:53,474 --> 00:02:55,676
Although that could
be very Mossad.

43
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:58,279
I wish. I'd be better
funded. No, no, no.

44
00:02:58,412 --> 00:03:01,614
I work for another watchful
shop, the name of which

45
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:04,985
has not come up in your
conversations with them.

46
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:07,288
A stake in the
story I'm writing.

47
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:11,825
You have me bugged, or you
want me to think you do.

48
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:14,828
We were tracking 900
of them a month ago.

49
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:18,465
We're tracking 1,600 now.

50
00:03:18,466 --> 00:03:20,067
The Great Conversion.

51
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:22,903
It's real. It's happening.

52
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,638
Well, then you have a
more immediate problem

53
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,741
than a book being
researched. Got a name?

54
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:33,914
You're not the first to
attempt this, Mr. Molloy.

55
00:03:35,283 --> 00:03:37,417
I could give you the names
of four others who have

56
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:39,720
and they're all dead, or undead.

57
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,590
The name is Raglan James.

58
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,158
Got a real name?

59
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:49,161
Files have been placed,
with proper encryption,

60
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:52,433
on your comically
vulnerable laptop.

61
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:55,569
Most are primary sources
that your infamous friends...

62
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:58,205
Anyone here a fan of
intelligence officers?

63
00:03:58,306 --> 00:03:59,772
We got a live one.

64
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:01,573
Gochisousama, Taisho-san.

65
00:04:23,331 --> 00:04:25,966
How was your
walkabout, Mr. Molloy?

66
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:29,537
Michelin fish in the desert.
I burned my entire per diem.

67
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:33,407
How many people in the world
know what you know, Rashid?

68
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:36,008
How many Rashids, Rashid?

69
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,678
I suspect just enough to
help them stay hidden.

70
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:41,315
No, that's how billionaire
vampires do it.

71
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:43,951
How does your
average Jo Mo vampire

72
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:47,287
keep people like you in
line? Unspoken threats?

73
00:04:47,388 --> 00:04:50,958
The threat is always there.
He could kill us both now.

74
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:53,627
But he doesn't. They
are peaceful beings.

75
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:55,496
They drain and disappear us.

76
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:57,264
They have a
biological imperative

77
00:04:57,365 --> 00:04:59,933
that is in conflict
with human morality.

78
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:02,636
But what is that morality
other than rules agreed upon?

79
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:04,171
Thank you, Rashid.

80
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:11,445
A romantic answer
to your question.

81
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:14,982
The average vampire has
minimal contact with humanity.

82
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:19,019
When exposed, they feed
or run or kill themselves.

83
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:21,522
And I'd say we're
multi-millionaires.

84
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:23,691
Not quite a billion.

85
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,529
It was wrong of Louis to
enter your memories yesterday.

86
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,131
You were invited
here as a guest.

87
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:33,834
- Cell phones.
- You were rude, but he crossed a line.

88
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:36,269
Artificial intelligence
crunching improbable data.

89
00:05:36,404 --> 00:05:38,438
- I offer my apology...
- How do you hide from the cloud?

90
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,873
On his behalf.

91
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:42,876
We should probably wait for him.

92
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:46,046
Probably.

93
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:52,553
He'll awaken when
the sun sleeps.

94
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:04,597
Your cell phones make you
slaves to your fetishes

95
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:07,735
and data retrieval is
primarily about profits,

96
00:06:07,835 --> 00:06:11,672
so I suspect no one at Amazon
is trying to sell us blenders.

97
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:14,174
You kill, nightly.

98
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:17,578
And sometimes you've watched
that kill on the local news.

99
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,682
You've never been
easier to distract.

100
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:24,651
You're at the height
of wilful ignorance.

101
00:06:24,652 --> 00:06:27,254
We exploit it. This is, was...

102
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:31,592
Lestat's prophetic vision.

103
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:38,098
- Lestat de Lioncourt?
- Yes.

104
00:06:39,667 --> 00:06:42,570
We were shadows
crouching behind stone

105
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,772
prior to his transformation.

106
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,608
I'm listening.

107
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,444
That's my job, right?

108
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:56,083
<i>It was 1556 when the
Roman coven sent me</i>

109
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,285
<i>to lead the shambolic
Paris coven.</i>

110
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:00,820
<i>A face from the subcontinent,</i>

111
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:04,257
<i>French my fourth and
poorest language,</i>

112
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,594
<i>I had never led
anything in my life.</i>

113
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:10,931
<i>We called ourselves the
Children of Darkness.</i>

114
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:13,433
<i>We lived in squalor,
hunted in shame,</i>

115
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:16,169
<i>all in strict obedience
to medieval laws</i>

116
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,439
<i>put in place to protect
us from humanity.</i>

117
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:22,075
<i>And though I managed to maintain</i>

118
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:28,175
<i>a discipline and humility for
239 years as Satan's fool,</i>

119
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:32,085
<i>by the time Robespierre
was beheaded,</i>

120
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:35,489
<i>I was, by any measure, failing.</i>

121
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,097
<i>Our ways were finished.</i>

122
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,166
<i>We were embers on a waning pyre.</i>

123
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:50,037
<i>Lestat was the wind to scatter.</i>

124
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,506
<i>I really gotta
meet with this guy.</i>

125
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:55,676
<i>I felt his presence
before I saw him.</i>

126
00:07:57,244 --> 00:07:59,613
<i>Sired by one of my
deserters, Magnus,</i>

127
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:02,281
<i>this was something new,</i>

128
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:04,917
<i>something I hadn't felt before.</i>

129
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:10,423
<i>The fourth of our
Great Laws was writ:</i>

130
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:14,027
<i>"No vampire shall ever reveal
his true nature to a mortal</i>

131
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:16,129
<i>and let that mortal live."</i>

132
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:21,301
<i>And here he was,
prancing and preening</i>

133
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:23,571
<i>in front of 500 mortals a night,</i>

134
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:26,473
<i>like some patronized,
tarted up dervish.</i>

135
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:29,942
<i>To hear Louis tell it...</i>

136
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:32,212
Lestat becoming a vampire
was a horror show.

137
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:33,847
That may be.

138
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:36,850
But he made a remarkable
recovery shortly thereafter.

139
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:41,221
<i>How else could you explain
his hand feeding the audience?</i>

140
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,992
<i>How words came
out like canaries,</i>

141
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:47,994
<i>summer fruit in
the dead of winter.</i>

142
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:50,363
<i>They were all in love with him.</i>

143
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,766
<i>He had that effect on everyone.</i>

144
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:55,435
<i>- He...
- Was a natural?</i>

145
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,437
<i>Entirely un-natural.</i>

146
00:08:58,105 --> 00:09:03,142
<i>Using the Dark Gift for what?
His vanity? It was heresy.</i>

147
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:06,747
<i>I had to bring him under
my control by any means.</i>

148
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:50,489
<i>I followed him for weeks.</i>

149
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,794
<i>His rejections only inflamed me.</i>

150
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:56,764
<i>And the longer I allowed him
to exist outside the coven,</i>

151
00:09:56,864 --> 00:10:00,701
<i>the more unsettled
my children became.</i>

152
00:10:00,868 --> 00:10:04,337
<i>They watched in secret,
fascinated by his disregard</i>

153
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:07,975
<i>for the laws I told them
could never be broken.</i>

154
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:12,913
<i>He took a mortal
lover. More heresy.</i>

155
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:41,267
<i>I'd tolerated his
presence too long already.</i>

156
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:44,337
<i>I had to act or he'd destroy
what little I had left.</i>

157
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:46,239
Lestat!

158
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,915
Lestat?

159
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:57,017
Nicky!

160
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,458
Uhh! Uhh!

161
00:12:56,043 --> 00:12:57,310
Nicky!

162
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:34,614
Uhh!

163
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:36,243
You let it happen?

164
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,610
Yes.

165
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,647
You led him there, so
he could destroy it.

166
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:44,351
His words had been my
thoughts for half a century.

167
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:47,587
If it had come from me, they
wouldn't have believed it.

168
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:56,763
Hmm?

169
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:16,549
<i>My children left.</i>

170
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:17,985
<i>They roamed the
streets of Paris,</i>

171
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:19,919
<i>wreaking havoc with mortals.</i>

172
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,290
Some could not reconcile
the life I had made for them

173
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:26,426
with the life Lestat had
told them was possible.

174
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:30,897
They went mad, ended themselves.

175
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:36,636
<i>The only thing that
kept me from the fire...</i>

176
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,739
<i>were the old rituals.</i>

177
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,625
<i>Au contraire, Maitre.</i>

178
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:50,189
Lestat.

179
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:15,715
That's it? You're just
going to end it there?

180
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:18,317
They went at it on the floor.

181
00:20:18,318 --> 00:20:20,887
Armand taught Lestat
the Mind Gift.

182
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:24,391
And a week later,
Lestat was gone.

183
00:20:24,491 --> 00:20:27,727
The question was how do
vampires hide from Google,

184
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,363
not how did Lestat
break his heart.

185
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:32,932
But because you were a good
listener, you got answers to both.

186
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:35,067
When he went to open the
theater the next night,

187
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:37,437
he was met by the
lawyer, Pierre Roget I.

188
00:20:37,537 --> 00:20:40,072
Waiting for me with a trunk
full of cash and instructions

189
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:42,409
to cover the theater's
cost in perpetuity.

190
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:46,713
He abandoned Nicky. He abandoned
Armand. He abandoned the coven.

191
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:51,950
Lestat is, was, and will
always be, for Lestat.

192
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:54,554
Never say I love you
to a raging narcissist.

193
00:20:54,654 --> 00:20:58,057
And I locked away those
words for another 150 years.

194
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:02,295
And then he arrived...

195
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,131
and shattered that lock.

196
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:10,603
This is what... frightened
me most about you.

197
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,543
He's in Copenhagen

198
00:21:17,544 --> 00:21:19,211
working at a car factory.

199
00:21:19,346 --> 00:21:22,315
He hates his maker, takes
the boat back to America.

200
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:24,716
He gets me on an El
train to Chicago.

201
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:27,787
I said outside of Chicago. He
said he didn't like big cities.

202
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,721
He gets me outside Chicago.

203
00:21:29,722 --> 00:21:32,992
- A diner on the way to Gary.
- You find me in Springfield...

204
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,161
Selling chestnuts outside
the train station.

205
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:37,228
By the train station.

206
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:39,666
He kills himself in Cincinnati.

207
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:42,502
What the hell do we
know about Cincinnati?

208
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:44,837
What do they know
about Cincinnati?

209
00:21:46,072 --> 00:21:48,140
- What's he look like?
- They won't ask that.

210
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,610
- They will.
- It's been weeks, it's enough.

211
00:21:50,743 --> 00:21:53,346
I'm finally working backstage
tonight, I don't wanna be late.

212
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,515
You're the one said
he was our maker.

213
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:58,249
I need this cold for myself.

214
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:02,355
Black wavy hair... smile
crooks up to the left.

215
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:04,657
Buncha moles on his
crotch and thighs.

216
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:06,425
I don't need that.

217
00:22:06,426 --> 00:22:08,828
Well, he didn't keep you
under floorboards for a week.

218
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:10,697
I don't know what
it is that you need.

219
00:22:10,797 --> 00:22:13,032
I remember what I remember.

220
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,207
I pry to keep us safe.

221
00:22:22,308 --> 00:22:24,711
You might be having
a good time now,

222
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:27,380
but there's danger if
they find out we lied.

223
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:33,185
Maybe not Cincinnati.
How about Shreveport?

224
00:22:35,922 --> 00:22:39,124
Caddo Lake. My daddy took
me and Paul there to fish.

225
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:41,828
There's a drawbridge there.
He burned on the bridge.

226
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:44,797
Shreveport, Caddo Lake,
burned himself on the bridge.

227
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:54,741
Armand.

228
00:22:56,476 --> 00:22:57,877
The door was ajar.

229
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:02,415
Uh... If you open up the
windows and the doors,

230
00:23:02,515 --> 00:23:04,684
you get a little breeze.

231
00:23:04,784 --> 00:23:07,953
Cavalier. But I'm sure
you're being careful.

232
00:23:07,954 --> 00:23:09,088
A-huh.

233
00:23:11,824 --> 00:23:14,260
Maitre, welcome to our lair.

234
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:18,230
- Shouldn't you be in the lobby?
- I got three minutes.

235
00:23:18,865 --> 00:23:20,933
Did I give you consent to
look me in the eye, Puce?

236
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:23,334
- No, Maitre.
- My fault, I was keeping her.

237
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:25,336
Have I been late once, Maitre?

238
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:27,874
Have you been early once is the
question I'd be asking myself.

239
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:37,784
How's she doing?

240
00:23:39,385 --> 00:23:41,621
She's taking the
abuse in stride.

241
00:23:41,721 --> 00:23:44,123
- I've never seen her happier.
- Mmm.

242
00:23:45,558 --> 00:23:48,595
The coven has grand
designs for her.

243
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:54,365
You're drawn to portraiture.

244
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:56,636
Hides the cracks in the walls.

245
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:06,479
Show me where you go at night.

246
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:14,086
Unconscious death is
the fate of all mortals.

247
00:24:15,755 --> 00:24:17,323
Up.

248
00:24:18,224 --> 00:24:19,258
Up.

249
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:20,927
Up.

250
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:25,031
We are conscious
death, Rolf Wangler.

251
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:28,801
<i>And that would
make you a groom.</i>

252
00:24:30,036 --> 00:24:35,107
<i>Do you know what it means
to be loved by death?</i>

253
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:37,408
<i>No pain.</i>

254
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:39,245
This is my favorite part.

255
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:40,879
<i>No pain.</i>

256
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,448
No pain.

257
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:44,016
<i>No pain.</i>

258
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:46,352
How does he get
'em to beg for it?

259
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:49,420
Eyes down, Puce, eyes down.

260
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:51,290
No pain.

261
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,792
No pain.

262
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:00,299
Did you fucking
sneeze at the end?

263
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:01,933
I tried to stifle it.

264
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:04,503
It's the bloody fucking
moment of quietus.

265
00:25:04,604 --> 00:25:06,205
It's hay season.

266
00:25:06,305 --> 00:25:08,140
It's not a farm, Estelle!

267
00:25:08,975 --> 00:25:12,277
It still sounded terrifying,
Mr. Santiago. I got chills.

268
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:14,279
Of course you did
because I'm a...

269
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,114
Fucking professional!

270
00:25:16,115 --> 00:25:17,650
- Puce!
- Coming, sir.

271
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:21,387
You know, Clau, this is
what's called the wet room.

272
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,955
A hateful place. You
never get over the smell

273
00:25:23,956 --> 00:25:26,457
and I'm glad to Garryduff
it's your job now.

274
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:29,495
Keep the sacrifice in there
till ten minutes to the stage.

275
00:25:29,629 --> 00:25:32,231
- Mm-hm.
- This is the body box.

276
00:25:34,801 --> 00:25:38,037
And this is the rat box.
You put your freshie...

277
00:25:38,971 --> 00:25:40,438
in the body box.

278
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:43,009
You close the lid.

279
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:45,244
You take the safety
off the funnel.

280
00:25:47,113 --> 00:25:49,981
And, begosh and begorrah,
the rats do the dirty for ya.

281
00:25:49,982 --> 00:25:53,019
Now on a Tuesday, this is the
body box and that's the rat box.

282
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:56,487
On Wednesdays, that's the
body box, this is the rat box.

283
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:59,726
Back and forth, back
and forth. Keep track.

284
00:25:59,826 --> 00:26:02,493
These rats are smart.
They can go quiet.

285
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:04,694
You open up the wrong box,
they go running up the stairs

286
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:06,171
into the green room,
into the theater

287
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:07,672
and Maitre punishes
the entire coven,

288
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:09,367
which does not win you
friends and furain.

289
00:26:09,368 --> 00:26:11,070
We had an incinerator at home.

290
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:13,130
- How'd that work?
- Throw 'em in. Watch 'em burn.

291
00:26:13,172 --> 00:26:15,041
Hmm. Feels a bit German.

292
00:26:15,174 --> 00:26:17,414
You can piddle a week before
you have to empty the bones.

293
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:20,613
This door leads to the sewers,
catacombs and various ossuaries

294
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:22,447
we've got hidden
around the underground.

295
00:26:22,448 --> 00:26:25,217
- What are these?
- Burial vaults.

296
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:28,621
Coven members past. Mostly
heretics and law breakers.

297
00:26:28,721 --> 00:26:31,423
- What are the laws?
- Not till the ceremony, Puce.

298
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:34,460
They found the heart!

299
00:26:35,494 --> 00:26:37,429
Rats love hearts.

300
00:26:39,866 --> 00:26:42,401
I walk a new part of
the city every night.

301
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:44,202
I try to get lost.

302
00:26:44,203 --> 00:26:47,573
Somehow I always end
up back by the river.

303
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:52,177
The waters of the Seine,
contained and beautiful.

304
00:26:52,178 --> 00:26:53,245
Mm-hm.

305
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:56,816
A vein winding through
the heart of Paris.

306
00:27:01,187 --> 00:27:03,322
There's much talk of
your camera in the coven.

307
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,324
Is that right?

308
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,225
They say you're mad
in love with humanity.

309
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:10,129
Thieving their private
moments with light and shadow.

310
00:27:10,229 --> 00:27:12,598
They pester Claudia about it.

311
00:27:12,699 --> 00:27:14,600
They should ask me
if they're curious.

312
00:27:14,701 --> 00:27:17,402
How could they when
you're so rarely present?

313
00:27:17,403 --> 00:27:21,007
I saw enough theater back
home for several lifetimes.

314
00:27:21,107 --> 00:27:23,408
- No offense.
- None taken.

315
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:26,145
Nothing worse than being
dragged around unwillingly

316
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:29,181
by a companion.
This was Bruce?

317
00:27:29,949 --> 00:27:32,151
Yeah, Bruce.

318
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:36,155
- The opera-loving motorcyclist.
- Yeah.

319
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:39,802
You should talk with
Tuan Pham about cameras.

320
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:42,194
He's very learned. Perhaps
the two of you could...

321
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:44,363
I'm not doing the coven.

322
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:47,398
Trying to save
you a sales pitch.

323
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:50,536
You got Claudia, she's
happy, I'm happy.

324
00:27:51,237 --> 00:27:52,705
But me...

325
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,341
- not much of a joiner.
- Mmm.

326
00:27:55,441 --> 00:27:58,010
Yes, you have made
that clear enough.

327
00:27:58,144 --> 00:28:00,046
So if that's why you're here.

328
00:28:01,247 --> 00:28:02,948
It's not the whole
reason I'm here.

329
00:28:02,949 --> 00:28:04,950
- No.
- No.

330
00:28:04,951 --> 00:28:07,820
It's most definitely not
the whole reason he's here.

331
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:11,190
I like you.

332
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:14,994
I like you, isn't that obvious?

333
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,900
We really must work on
blocking your thoughts.

334
00:28:21,868 --> 00:28:24,136
- Excuse me?
- Bruce.

335
00:28:24,971 --> 00:28:27,706
- I sense him now in your mind.
- A-huh.

336
00:28:27,807 --> 00:28:29,909
Maybe I'm guarding my
thoughts just fine.

337
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:32,411
Maybe I let you into
my head on purpose.

338
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,847
Oh, that's nice,
mon cher. Lovely.

339
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:52,598
Ha!

340
00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:07,880
If we were the only
vampires in Paris...

341
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,951
For a second I
felt like we were.

342
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:18,290
The coven is envious
of your independence.

343
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:21,627
It's a problem. You
outside looking in.

344
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,397
Your problem, not mine.

345
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:28,134
You want me, I'm here.

346
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,368
But I'm here, here.

347
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:33,105
In the streets, cafés,

348
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:35,207
the salons, the bars,
ripping hot jazz.

349
00:29:35,341 --> 00:29:37,675
The whole place feels
like it's born again.

350
00:29:37,676 --> 00:29:40,079
Everyone's asking, "What's
next, what's next?"

351
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:44,450
Not, "Where were you?"
Or, "Be careful."

352
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:46,485
I had enough of that back home.

353
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:49,488
I'm out here finding myself.

354
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:53,292
Then what room is
there left for me,

355
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:56,361
if you have not found yourself?

356
00:29:56,362 --> 00:29:57,663
Hmm!

357
00:29:59,932 --> 00:30:01,433
Oh, there's room.

358
00:30:09,075 --> 00:30:10,910
We were circling each other.

359
00:30:11,043 --> 00:30:13,179
I was putting him in a
very difficult position.

360
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,147
I was supposed to
be luring him in,

361
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:17,116
but the opposite was happening.

362
00:30:17,216 --> 00:30:18,985
I started spending less
time at the theater

363
00:30:19,085 --> 00:30:21,153
and more nights strolling
the boulevards with Louis.

364
00:30:21,253 --> 00:30:24,023
The conversation was
easy and flirtatious...

365
00:30:24,123 --> 00:30:26,458
- And combative.
- And combative, yes,

366
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:29,195
but only in the most
stimulating ways.

367
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:32,331
Arguing as foreplay.

368
00:30:32,464 --> 00:30:34,933
Some of my most
profound feelings

369
00:30:34,934 --> 00:30:37,102
and thoughts were taking shape.

370
00:30:37,103 --> 00:30:41,207
When my mind was
touched by Armand's,

371
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:45,311
I became deeply
excited and driven

372
00:30:45,411 --> 00:30:47,778
to form new conclusions
about myself

373
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:50,816
and vampiric life
in the abstract.

374
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,889
- Something wrong, Daniel?
- Mmm...

375
00:30:56,989 --> 00:31:02,127
Oh, no. It's... It's the,
um, the computer, uh...

376
00:31:02,128 --> 00:31:06,165
Something you were saying
made me think of, um...

377
00:31:07,433 --> 00:31:08,700
Think what?

378
00:31:11,003 --> 00:31:12,671
Oh... It's...

379
00:31:12,771 --> 00:31:15,741
It just flew out of my
head there. It's gone.

380
00:31:15,841 --> 00:31:18,744
So where's Claudia
at this point?

381
00:31:18,844 --> 00:31:21,180
How's she doing?
What... What's she doing

382
00:31:21,313 --> 00:31:23,916
at this stage of things?

383
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:28,853
How do you do it?

384
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:31,057
How do you get them
to accept death?

385
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,427
They'll never hear you in the
front row with your head down.

386
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:44,536
First thing I do when
I creak open the lid

387
00:31:45,704 --> 00:31:48,774
is have a chat with my
scene partner for the night.

388
00:31:49,675 --> 00:31:53,579
Muck about in their
heads, find their shame.

389
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,846
In short, an actor prepares.

390
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:58,217
See you on stage, Claude.

391
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:02,454
Who's Francis Naughton?

392
00:32:07,994 --> 00:32:11,029
The best Iago to
walk the York Royal.

393
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,464
That was you?

394
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:15,634
And what was your
shabby life in Chicago

395
00:32:15,734 --> 00:32:19,471
before the vampire Bruce
bit down on your wee neck?

396
00:32:19,571 --> 00:32:21,140
I was in Springfield...

397
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:24,476
selling little trinkets
at the train station.

398
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,711
- You were an orphan?
- You could say that.

399
00:32:26,712 --> 00:32:30,249
And an orphan again.
We have that in common.

400
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:32,951
- I thought Maitre made you?
- And why would you say that?

401
00:32:33,052 --> 00:32:35,287
Estelle told me you
were the youngest.

402
00:32:35,387 --> 00:32:38,457
But you're also the strongest.
Figured you got the best blood.

403
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:40,659
No.

404
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,296
My maker lies in the
walls downstairs.

405
00:32:45,764 --> 00:32:47,432
Maitre put him there.

406
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:49,768
Woodcutter, three minutes.

407
00:32:50,536 --> 00:32:52,004
Thank you. Three.

408
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:54,440
- Sorry.
- Oh, don't be.

409
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,642
He deserved his death...

410
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,512
and his blood was exquisite.

411
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,415
I'm a good mimic and I can fly.

412
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:07,986
- And you kill with panache.
- Hmm.

413
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,089
And your dearly departed maker,

414
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:14,360
what gifts did he bequeath
the moppet vampiress?

415
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:18,197
He taught me how to lie well.

416
00:33:22,901 --> 00:33:25,171
You'll make a fine actor, then.

417
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:30,842
It's Louis who's
from Chicago, yes?

418
00:33:31,777 --> 00:33:34,346
Just outside it. Gary, Indiana.

419
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:39,818
Stick with it, Puce.
You're almost there.

420
00:33:49,928 --> 00:33:53,298
I'm evil, evil as any
vampire who ever lived.

421
00:33:53,299 --> 00:33:57,102
I've killed over and over
and I will do it again.

422
00:33:57,103 --> 00:34:00,038
Why does that make you
as evil as any vampire?

423
00:34:00,172 --> 00:34:01,639
Aren't there gradations to evil?

424
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,641
Is evil a great perilous gulf

425
00:34:03,642 --> 00:34:05,476
one falls into
with the first sin?

426
00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:09,715
I mean, kinda. It's not as
logical as you're saying,

427
00:34:09,848 --> 00:34:11,850
but it's dark and it's empty,

428
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:13,585
and I can't see
the bottom of it.

429
00:34:13,685 --> 00:34:16,987
But if evil is without
gradation and it does exist,

430
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:19,325
this state of evil then,

431
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:21,527
only one sin is needed.

432
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,329
That's your argument.

433
00:34:25,831 --> 00:34:30,035
Evil is the product of
the ability of humans

434
00:34:30,136 --> 00:34:32,771
to make abstract
what is concrete.

435
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:35,607
- Jean-Paul.
- Armand.

436
00:34:35,707 --> 00:34:38,210
- This is my friend, Louis.
- Bonjour.

437
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:42,414
Now, will you two
kindly shut up,

438
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:45,117
so I can hear the music, hmm?

439
00:34:46,885 --> 00:34:49,487
<i>Your argument
assumes God exists.</i>

440
00:34:49,488 --> 00:34:51,456
<i>I don't know that God exists.</i>

441
00:34:51,457 --> 00:34:53,825
<i>From what I saw in
the war, he doesn't.</i>

442
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,928
<i>Then surely, there are degrees
and variations to goodness?</i>

443
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,631
<i>The goodness of the
child which is innocence.</i>

444
00:34:59,731 --> 00:35:01,633
<i>The goodness of the
nun who lives a life</i>

445
00:35:01,733 --> 00:35:04,270
<i>of self-deprivation and service.</i>

446
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:07,739
<i>The goodness of the saints,
the goodness of the midwives.</i>

447
00:35:07,906 --> 00:35:10,175
<i>And how is this evil achieved?</i>

448
00:35:10,176 --> 00:35:12,311
<i>How does one fall from grace?</i>

449
00:35:12,478 --> 00:35:16,748
<i>♪ You little whore ♪</i>

450
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,557
<i>♪ Come to me ♪</i>

451
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:32,364
<i>♪ He'll never run his

452
00:35:32,531 --> 00:35:36,401

That's quite good, hmm.

453
00:35:36,402 --> 00:35:38,670

454
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,105

457
00:35:46,044 --> 00:35:47,613
Maybe you're right.

458
00:35:48,747 --> 00:35:50,015
There he is again.

459
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:53,084
<i>♪ Come to me ♪</i>

460
00:35:53,219 --> 00:35:54,520
I'm sorry.

461
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:56,921
And we were having such
a nice conversation.

462
00:35:56,922 --> 00:36:01,026
I was with Bruce for 30 years.

463
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,361
"Bruce"?

464
00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:06,298
How long are we going
to play games, Louis?

465
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:13,103
- Lestat...
- Before you say it,

466
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:15,306
let me tell you a
little something

467
00:36:15,307 --> 00:36:17,843
about 18th-century Armand.

468
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:20,479
- Lestat.
- Oh, dear.

469
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:23,682
- Finally.
- I'm tired of holding onto it.

470
00:36:24,416 --> 00:36:27,653
Lestat was my
companion in America.

471
00:36:27,786 --> 00:36:31,390
- And where is he now?
- Mm, still a bookbinder's wife?

472
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:33,958
- He knows.
- You know where he is.

473
00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:36,027
I want you to say it.

474
00:36:37,463 --> 00:36:39,865
I killed him and he
fucking had it coming.

475
00:36:39,965 --> 00:36:42,534
- Well, that's debatable.
- I've known for months.

476
00:36:43,168 --> 00:36:44,969
I've just waited
for you to say it.

477
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:48,073
And that means what?
You gotta kill me now?

478
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:53,078
What does that mean for Claudia?

479
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,680
- Did she help you kill him?
- Yes!

480
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,882
- No.
- You broke one of the Great Laws.

481
00:36:56,982 --> 00:36:59,685
I don't know any Great Laws.
Lestat never told me shit.

482
00:36:59,818 --> 00:37:02,254
- I told you I loved you.
- Go away!

483
00:37:02,354 --> 00:37:03,754
- Calm down.
- And you said nothing.

484
00:37:03,822 --> 00:37:05,757
Back to hell with you!

485
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:09,361
Louis...

486
00:37:39,658 --> 00:37:43,562
Even now, I'm still
the only one you trust.

487
00:37:45,731 --> 00:37:46,932
Kill me again.

488
00:37:47,733 --> 00:37:50,135
Go on, kill me again!

489
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:56,475
Show me the only way
you know how to love.

490
00:38:05,417 --> 00:38:08,086
Aah! Uhh! Aah!

491
00:38:21,867 --> 00:38:24,102
He was a loner.
Had fickle moods,

492
00:38:24,202 --> 00:38:26,404
switched between 'em real fast.

493
00:38:26,405 --> 00:38:28,507
We can take a night off.

494
00:38:29,575 --> 00:38:31,510
Uh, you're probably right.

495
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:34,480
Probably let it go after
we said he burned himself.

496
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:37,282
No, we should do this. We should
be real careful, like you said.

497
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,120
Louis?

498
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:49,361
Three of us were a
little gang for a while.

499
00:38:51,129 --> 00:38:54,765
The open road, roaming America.

500
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:57,301
Killing at truck stops, motels.

501
00:38:57,302 --> 00:39:00,938
Till one day he set himself on
fire. Shocked the shit outta us.

502
00:39:00,939 --> 00:39:02,940
Did it with a lighter.

503
00:39:02,941 --> 00:39:05,210
Held it up to a rag
hanging out his gas tank.

504
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,778
Thought we'd be on that
road for a long time.

505
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:09,347
His last words were...

506
00:39:10,816 --> 00:39:13,184
"Had enough of
your gloomy faces."

507
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,053
Good.

508
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,029
Lestat could have said,

509
00:39:24,162 --> 00:39:27,533
"Put your coffin on
a boat. Go to Paris.

510
00:39:27,633 --> 00:39:29,234
There's a beautiful coven there,

511
00:39:29,334 --> 00:39:31,403
I know cos I
fucking founded it."

512
00:39:33,772 --> 00:39:36,207
But he said the vampires
out there are vicious.

513
00:39:36,341 --> 00:39:38,410
I should tell you something.

514
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:42,247
And then I met the motherfucker,
and, yeah, Lestat was right.

515
00:39:45,283 --> 00:39:47,519
It was better when
he broke my bones,

516
00:39:49,788 --> 00:39:52,057
crammed me under
the floorboards.

517
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:56,862
I fought him, kicked him,

518
00:39:56,995 --> 00:39:59,097
clawed him, bit him.

519
00:40:01,366 --> 00:40:02,934
That was fine.

520
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,405
It was when he had me pinned,

521
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:11,910
and he'd tell me he loved me.

522
00:40:15,313 --> 00:40:17,949
Before, during,

523
00:40:18,684 --> 00:40:20,118
and after.

524
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:23,622
Before, during,

525
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:26,291
after.

526
00:40:27,192 --> 00:40:28,960
That fucked me up.

527
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:35,901
One day he said, "Had
enough of your gloomy face."

528
00:40:37,002 --> 00:40:38,970
Drove off on a motorbike.

529
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:42,641
Thought I might as well go
home, get Louis, head to Europe.

530
00:40:45,577 --> 00:40:48,113
They're gonna let me join
the coven end of this week.

531
00:40:51,917 --> 00:40:53,752
It'd be nice if you come.

532
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,122
I wouldn't miss
it for the world.

533
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:09,334
Excuse the interruption.

534
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:13,839
The lawyer for the buyer is
ready for the teleconference.

535
00:41:14,606 --> 00:41:16,141
Uh, the lawyer?

536
00:41:16,274 --> 00:41:18,343
It's about the Bacon triptych.

537
00:41:19,778 --> 00:41:22,814
- Would you mind, Daniel?
- I'll take a piss.

538
00:41:27,385 --> 00:41:31,690
A real cold cup of water there,
Rashid. I was really in it.

539
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,662
- Mr. Philips, yes?
<i>- Hello.</i>

540
00:41:36,795 --> 00:41:38,530
This is the owner, Mr. Du Lac.

541
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:40,165
Mr. Philips.

542
00:41:44,603 --> 00:41:47,104
Three Studies for Figures at
the Base of a Crucifixion,

543
00:41:47,105 --> 00:41:49,307
witnesses to Christ's agony.

544
00:41:49,407 --> 00:41:52,476
Mr. Bacon also referred to
these as the Three Furies,

545
00:41:52,477 --> 00:41:54,479
punishers of human wrongdoing.

546
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,281
<i>And the matter of provenance?</i>

547
00:41:56,414 --> 00:41:58,984
Is the buyer questioning
the authenticity?

548
00:41:59,084 --> 00:42:01,152
<i>The buyer wants it
for her husband.</i>

549
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:03,588
<i>She probably Googled what
questions she should ask.</i>

550
00:42:03,589 --> 00:42:06,858
The reverse on the right panel
is inscribed Petersfield,

551
00:42:06,992 --> 00:42:08,926
which is near a
cottage Bacon worked at

552
00:42:08,927 --> 00:42:11,095
during the gestating
years of the painting.

553
00:42:11,096 --> 00:42:13,964
An X-ray of the Fury on
that panel would reveal

554
00:42:13,965 --> 00:42:17,235
the face of a man, likely Eric
Hall, the owner of that cottage.

555
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,803
It's only had three owners.

556
00:42:18,804 --> 00:42:20,638
The research is
basic but on you.

557
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:22,540
We have to run. Thank you.

558
00:42:22,641 --> 00:42:24,409
<i>I'll run it past my clients.</i>

559
00:42:24,509 --> 00:42:27,746
- Woodcutter!
- Who are you?

560
00:42:27,846 --> 00:42:32,751
I am who you think
I am, woodcutter.

561
00:42:32,851 --> 00:42:36,521
- Go away.
- The clock in your heart.

562
00:42:36,622 --> 00:42:40,425
The gears have stopped meshing.

563
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:47,398
The vampires are real.
They're going to kill us all.

564
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:51,168
The vampires, they're real!

565
00:42:51,169 --> 00:42:53,003
- They're going to kill us all!
- What is this?

566
00:42:53,004 --> 00:42:55,073
He's disrupted the performance!

567
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:57,642
No, no, no, no.
Let him speak, Sam.

568
00:42:57,643 --> 00:43:00,344
<i>Look who's graced us
with his presence.</i>

569
00:43:00,345 --> 00:43:01,946
<i>What an honor.</i>

570
00:43:01,947 --> 00:43:03,749
<i>He's here in
support of the girl.</i>

571
00:43:03,849 --> 00:43:07,184
<i>- Finish the performance.</i>
- Gonna to kill you next.

572
00:43:07,185 --> 00:43:09,788
Why don't you tell
us who you are?

573
00:43:09,888 --> 00:43:13,424
<i>- Did you read Le Monde today?
- I have not.</i>

574
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:16,493
<i>A mutilated body found in
a park three nights ago.</i>

575
00:43:16,494 --> 00:43:19,765
<i>Crushed skull, puncture
wounds on neck,</i>

576
00:43:19,865 --> 00:43:21,633
<i>chest and shoulder blade.</i>

577
00:43:21,733 --> 00:43:25,169
<i>- Was that you?
- Of course not.</i>

578
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:27,872
<i>Because everyone was
in coffin by curfew.</i>

579
00:43:27,873 --> 00:43:31,677
Suppose we were to let you go?

580
00:43:31,777 --> 00:43:33,979
<i>And I don't see our girl here</i>

581
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,148
<i>at that particular park, do you?</i>

582
00:43:37,248 --> 00:43:39,049
<i>Speak plainly.</i>

583
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:41,152
<i>You've had your
time to recruit.</i>

584
00:43:41,252 --> 00:43:43,254
<i>It's not happening.</i>

585
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:46,992
<i>He will be the ruin of
us. Do what must be done.</i>

586
00:43:47,092 --> 00:43:48,860
<i>Are you making demands?</i>

587
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,663
<i>The coven would like to know</i>

588
00:43:51,763 --> 00:43:53,765
<i>what you intend to do with him,</i>

589
00:43:53,865 --> 00:43:56,467
<i>beyond comping him a fifth
row center aisle ticket?</i>

590
00:43:57,035 --> 00:43:59,270
<i>And do you speak
for the coven?</i>

591
00:44:14,753 --> 00:44:16,654
<i>After the ceremony.</i>

592
00:44:16,755 --> 00:44:18,957
<i>After she's committed
herself to us.</i>

593
00:44:19,557 --> 00:44:22,392
<i>Then I'll do what must be
done. Does that satisfy?</i>

594
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:26,631
<i>- Did in my maker for far less.
- Does that satisfy?</i>

595
00:44:26,798 --> 00:44:29,433
<i>It does, Maitre.</i>

596
00:44:29,434 --> 00:44:31,169
<i>All respects.</i>

597
00:44:32,603 --> 00:44:34,005
No pain.

598
00:44:34,773 --> 00:44:36,975
No pain.

599
00:44:37,976 --> 00:44:39,845
No pain.

600
00:44:46,317 --> 00:44:48,953
Puce! Puce! Puce!

601
00:44:48,954 --> 00:44:52,390
Puce! Puce! Puce! Puce! Puce!

602
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:02,400
Your first night
over the footlights.

603
00:45:03,368 --> 00:45:05,904
- How did it feel?
- Like home.

604
00:45:07,605 --> 00:45:10,341
Come, I have something for you.

605
00:45:11,509 --> 00:45:12,744
Sit.

606
00:45:22,988 --> 00:45:24,689
What is it, Maitre?

607
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:26,758
It's a flea circus.

608
00:45:30,128 --> 00:45:33,698
May it remind you of
your humble beginnings.

609
00:45:34,499 --> 00:45:36,234
Would you have us?

610
00:45:40,305 --> 00:45:42,107
Yes, Maitre.

611
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:44,674
Come.

612
00:45:50,916 --> 00:45:52,349
The Five Laws.

613
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:55,620
Let youngest read
in the youngest.

614
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:02,961
The ceremony is
for members only.

615
00:46:03,895 --> 00:46:05,630
Shall we have a walk?

616
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:12,804
The Five Laws.

617
00:46:14,172 --> 00:46:15,573
<i>Law one.</i>

618
00:46:16,241 --> 00:46:19,144
<i>Each coven must have its leader</i>

619
00:46:19,244 --> 00:46:21,012
<i>and only he might order</i>

620
00:46:21,179 --> 00:46:23,949
<i>the working of the Dark
Trick upon a mortal.</i>

621
00:46:26,517 --> 00:46:28,419
<i>Will you abide?</i>

622
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,455
I will.

623
00:46:30,555 --> 00:46:31,756
Law two.

624
00:46:33,058 --> 00:46:36,962
The Dark Gifts must never
be given to the crippled,

625
00:46:37,062 --> 00:46:38,964
the maimed or to children...

626
00:46:39,064 --> 00:46:42,066
- I'm gonna leave Paris.
- Where would you go?

627
00:46:42,067 --> 00:46:44,601
I was thinking London.

628
00:46:44,602 --> 00:46:46,637
If it's too large, maybe Dublin.

629
00:46:47,572 --> 00:46:49,507
You left a body in the park.

630
00:46:50,408 --> 00:46:51,943
More reason I should leave.

631
00:46:52,043 --> 00:46:54,645
No vampire must
commit to writing

632
00:46:54,779 --> 00:46:56,614
the history of the vampires.

633
00:46:56,747 --> 00:47:01,286
You exposed us. Should I allow
the London coven such exposure?

634
00:47:04,589 --> 00:47:08,026
No vampire shall ever reveal
his or her true nature

635
00:47:08,126 --> 00:47:10,628
to a mortal and let
the mortal live.

636
00:47:10,728 --> 00:47:13,697
You revealed yourself to the
law firm of Roget & Abert.

637
00:47:13,698 --> 00:47:15,833
They do business with vampires.

638
00:47:15,934 --> 00:47:20,538
No vampire may ever
destroy another vampire...

639
00:47:21,472 --> 00:47:23,808
except that the coven master

640
00:47:23,909 --> 00:47:28,813
has the power of life and
death over all his flock.

641
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,781
"I will not harm you."

642
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:33,651
Those were your
first words to me.

643
00:47:33,751 --> 00:47:35,819
"My maker was a
vampire named Bruce.

644
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:39,490
Who's Lestat de Lioncourt?"
Your first words to the coven.

645
00:47:41,826 --> 00:47:46,630
And it is his obligation to
finally seek the destruction

646
00:47:46,631 --> 00:47:50,101
of all those who have
broken these five laws.

647
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:51,668
<i>Where are we going?</i>

648
00:47:51,669 --> 00:47:53,371
We're going to get lost

649
00:47:53,471 --> 00:47:55,373
and end up back by the river.

650
00:47:56,341 --> 00:47:58,076
Like all our walks.

651
00:47:58,209 --> 00:48:01,546
Will you abide by this
fifth and final law?

652
00:48:02,447 --> 00:48:03,915
I will.

653
00:48:04,782 --> 00:48:06,217
A flea no more.

654
00:48:10,956 --> 00:48:13,191
<i>Take my head off if
you're gonna do it.</i>

655
00:48:14,059 --> 00:48:15,492
I saw what fire does.

656
00:48:15,493 --> 00:48:17,428
I don't want to go out that way.

657
00:48:17,528 --> 00:48:19,397
Any other requests?

658
00:48:19,864 --> 00:48:21,466
Look after Claudia.

659
00:48:21,566 --> 00:48:23,401
<i>She doesn't need
looking after.</i>

660
00:48:23,534 --> 00:48:25,436
<i>She won't be here very long.</i>

661
00:48:27,572 --> 00:48:28,773
What?!

662
00:48:29,507 --> 00:48:31,576
You made her at 14.

663
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:34,379
A most turbulent chemistry.

664
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,816
<i>Her mind, as fierce as it
is now, will not endure.</i>

665
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,785
<i>It will break apart in time.</i>

666
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:43,788
You don't know her.

667
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:47,725
I don't have to.

668
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,896
I've seen it all before.

669
00:48:54,032 --> 00:48:56,267
I've seen too much, Louis.

670
00:48:58,569 --> 00:49:00,638
Surprise!

671
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:04,475
You didn't think
we were going to

672
00:49:04,575 --> 00:49:06,410
leave you in the
wet room, did you?

673
00:49:06,411 --> 00:49:08,146
You're a star, Claudia.

674
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:10,648
A new play for you
and the ladies.

675
00:49:11,716 --> 00:49:14,084
'My Baby Loves Windows.'

676
00:49:14,085 --> 00:49:15,653
I play your governess.

677
00:49:15,753 --> 00:49:17,622
And I play your mother.

678
00:49:18,556 --> 00:49:20,658
And I play the little girl?

679
00:49:20,758 --> 00:49:23,594
You'll be their little
birdie for the next 50 years.

680
00:49:29,267 --> 00:49:31,269
What did he call it?

681
00:49:33,571 --> 00:49:36,141
'The Savage Garden.'

682
00:49:38,609 --> 00:49:40,778
Why is it, Louis,

683
00:49:41,412 --> 00:49:45,983
those with the most power
are often the weakest?

684
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,954
Don't give up on her.

685
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:54,625
Tell her she's beautiful.
Tell her that every morning.

686
00:50:26,157 --> 00:50:27,892
You walked me home.

687
00:50:29,694 --> 00:50:31,028
Did I?

688
00:50:31,829 --> 00:50:33,998
That's my building over there.

689
00:50:37,135 --> 00:50:38,903
Did he break you, Louis?

690
00:50:40,171 --> 00:50:41,906
Are you broken?

691
00:50:44,275 --> 00:50:45,410
No.

692
00:50:46,344 --> 00:50:48,079
But I carry him.

693
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,749
And I don't know if I...

694
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:54,085
if I can...

695
00:50:55,186 --> 00:50:57,255
The pain, the...

696
00:51:00,125 --> 00:51:01,559
You will.

697
00:51:03,661 --> 00:51:05,096
I did.

698
00:51:08,133 --> 00:51:09,567
You and him?

699
00:51:11,035 --> 00:51:12,903
A century or so ago.

700
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:15,540
Yesterday.

701
00:51:18,008 --> 00:51:20,044
What is time to a vampire?

702
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,829
You wanna come upstairs?

703
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:18,269
Are you inviting me in?

704
00:52:20,771 --> 00:52:23,674
Depends. Are you gonna kill me?

705
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:48,666
I'm a fierce vampire trapped
in the body of a little girl.

706
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:53,003
I'm reminded of it every
night of my existence.

707
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:54,439
There's something broken in me.

708
00:52:56,941 --> 00:52:59,977
Who am I? Am I my
history I have endured?

709
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:02,380
What is vampire life
but poor decisions?

710
00:53:03,981 --> 00:53:07,117
What about you and
me? Me and you?

711
00:53:07,285 --> 00:53:09,119
I want you. You
sure about that?

712
00:53:17,595 --> 00:53:21,499
Unconscious death is
the fate of all mortals.

713
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:23,934
Up.

714
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:28,439
Up. Mark: "No Pain" is
the name of episode three,

715
00:53:28,606 --> 00:53:32,743
and it is ironic because the
whole episode is about pain.

716
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:34,111
No pain.

717
00:53:35,145 --> 00:53:36,947
No pain.

718
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:44,522
We jump back in
time with Armand.

719
00:53:44,689 --> 00:53:47,091
What we get is
Armand's back story,

720
00:53:47,258 --> 00:53:49,169
which pulls a little bit
from the vampire, Lestat,

721
00:53:49,193 --> 00:53:50,795
which is the next book.

722
00:53:50,995 --> 00:53:53,130
So that's obviously exciting
for our literary fans.

723
00:53:53,264 --> 00:53:54,799
 Our ways were finished.

724
00:53:54,932 --> 00:53:57,201
We were embers on a waning pile.

725
00:53:57,368 --> 00:53:58,808
It also gives us
an opportunity

726
00:53:58,936 --> 00:54:00,347
to learn a little bit
more about the coven.

727
00:54:00,371 --> 00:54:02,239
Gets us some Lestat in there.

728
00:54:02,373 --> 00:54:04,642
And one of the best things
is that for a long time,

729
00:54:04,775 --> 00:54:06,277
we get the Louis
version of Lestat,

730
00:54:06,444 --> 00:54:08,713
and now we get the
Armand version of Lestat.

731
00:54:08,879 --> 00:54:09,959
And how are they different?

732
00:54:10,047 --> 00:54:11,716
And you watch Sam do that stuff,

733
00:54:11,882 --> 00:54:13,418
and it's just exquisite.

734
00:54:13,584 --> 00:54:16,253
Ah! Madame.

735
00:54:16,421 --> 00:54:17,788
By this point,

736
00:54:17,955 --> 00:54:20,391
we've learned that
who tells the story

737
00:54:20,558 --> 00:54:23,394
is often more important than
how the story is being told.

738
00:54:23,561 --> 00:54:25,229
How much of it is true?

739
00:54:25,396 --> 00:54:28,433
How much of it is used to
paint Armand in a good light?

740
00:54:29,967 --> 00:54:31,469
Lestat!

741
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:36,774
Tonight, we have a
little altercation

742
00:54:36,941 --> 00:54:39,577
between two vampires
and a mortal.

743
00:54:39,744 --> 00:54:41,412
Action!

744
00:54:41,579 --> 00:54:43,247
So I'm gonna be hurling Lestat

745
00:54:43,414 --> 00:54:45,583
up against that wall
just over there.

746
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:47,060
Levan, who's directing
this episode,

747
00:54:47,084 --> 00:54:48,653
is detail oriented,

748
00:54:48,819 --> 00:54:50,988
and he's a massive fan
of the books, as well,

749
00:54:51,155 --> 00:54:55,360
so he understands where this
particular part of the story

750
00:54:55,493 --> 00:54:57,828
fits narratively
in the next book.

751
00:54:59,464 --> 00:55:01,666
What I felt was
important in this scene,

752
00:55:01,832 --> 00:55:04,702
we have a time freeze
element that happens.

753
00:55:04,902 --> 00:55:08,005
We're using people who are
good at standing frozen,

754
00:55:08,172 --> 00:55:10,941
and we're using fishnets
to have dresses...

755
00:55:11,108 --> 00:55:13,177
It's very analogue,
which I like.

756
00:55:13,344 --> 00:55:14,679
It's pretty impressive I think.

757
00:55:14,845 --> 00:55:16,681
They've managed to
freeze some horses

758
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:19,350
in the background, so the horses
are being very well-behaved.

759
00:55:19,517 --> 00:55:22,387
I get dragged on a rig,
which was really fun to do,

760
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,154
and it's difficult
to see all those

761
00:55:24,288 --> 00:55:26,624
beautiful velvet wolf
killer coats get ripped up.

762
00:55:26,791 --> 00:55:29,126
It's lots of stunts.
It's lots of French.

763
00:55:34,865 --> 00:55:37,034
We've done a system,
we call it a slack line

764
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:38,703
and a nitrogen ratchet

765
00:55:38,869 --> 00:55:42,239
to motivate our stunt
performer toward the wall.

766
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,008
We always take what's on paper

767
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:46,310
and try to make it
bigger and better.

768
00:55:46,477 --> 00:55:47,812
As the scene progresses,

769
00:55:47,978 --> 00:55:49,980
the anger and the
emotion increases

770
00:55:50,147 --> 00:55:52,182
so the stunt becomes
bigger and bigger.

771
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:55,753
We go from a slide and a flick
to flying against the wall.

772
00:56:02,527 --> 00:56:04,361
You're not the first
to attempt this.

773
00:56:04,495 --> 00:56:06,495
I could give you the names
of four others who have.

774
00:56:06,631 --> 00:56:08,766
And they're all dead, or undead.

775
00:56:08,899 --> 00:56:10,901
The Talamasca is very important

776
00:56:11,068 --> 00:56:13,604
to the Anne Rice canon.

777
00:56:13,804 --> 00:56:16,040
The files have been placed

778
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:21,579
with proper encryption on your
comically vulnerable laptop.

779
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:24,449
It's almost like "Men in Black".

780
00:56:24,649 --> 00:56:28,453
This is an organization that
oversees all of the demons,

781
00:56:28,653 --> 00:56:30,921
witches, vampires,

782
00:56:31,055 --> 00:56:35,092
all of this
unexplained phenomena.

783
00:56:35,259 --> 00:56:38,929
Anne Rice's imagination
seems to be limitless,

784
00:56:39,063 --> 00:56:41,699
and she's able to create a world

785
00:56:41,866 --> 00:56:43,801
and then add another
world onto it.

786
00:56:44,001 --> 00:56:46,737
So the Talamasca world
is... it's just wonderful.

787
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:49,774
It's a wonderful foil to
the whole vampire world.

788
00:56:55,279 --> 00:56:58,783
Louis, who we met
before he was a vampire,

789
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:01,919
he's almost like
an undercover agent

790
00:57:02,086 --> 00:57:04,655
in a world in which
he can't be found out.

791
00:57:04,855 --> 00:57:07,055
There is much talk of
your camera in the coffin.

792
00:57:07,124 --> 00:57:09,093
They say you're mad
in love with humanity,

793
00:57:09,226 --> 00:57:11,796
saving their private moments
with light and shadow.

794
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:13,798
So Louis is very tentative

795
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:16,601
and reluctant to join anybody.

796
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:19,737
Perhaps the two of you...
I'm not joining the coven.

797
00:57:19,904 --> 00:57:22,139
I think the coven, it's
a rejection of them

798
00:57:22,306 --> 00:57:24,642
and what a vampire should
be and shouldn't be,

799
00:57:24,809 --> 00:57:27,978
while Louis is always
teetering on ideas of morality

800
00:57:28,145 --> 00:57:30,848
and who he is and what's
right and what's wrong.

801
00:57:31,048 --> 00:57:32,983
He can't commit in the way

802
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:35,352
that they've committed
to their set of rules,

803
00:57:35,486 --> 00:57:36,766
and that just
makes him a target.

804
00:57:36,887 --> 00:57:38,756
I'm out here finding myself.

805
00:57:38,923 --> 00:57:41,492
Then what is there left for me?

806
00:57:41,659 --> 00:57:43,160
Oh, there's room.

807
00:57:50,901 --> 00:57:52,603
Stick with it, Puss.

808
00:57:52,737 --> 00:57:53,804
You're almost there.

809
00:57:53,938 --> 00:57:55,339
Puss. Flea.

810
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:56,674
It's a horrible nickname,

811
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:58,247
but Claudia doesn't
take any of it in

812
00:57:58,408 --> 00:57:59,786
because she realizes
what they're doing

813
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:01,646
in calling her
that, and it's flea,

814
00:58:01,812 --> 00:58:04,048
meaning little, like,
bottom of the barrel.

815
00:58:04,248 --> 00:58:06,517
They're gonna let me join
the coven end of this week.

816
00:58:08,586 --> 00:58:10,154
It'd be nice if you come.

817
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,156
As an audience, everybody
roots for Claudia

818
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:15,793
because she demands
to be taken seriously.

819
00:58:18,462 --> 00:58:20,865
Claudia is very intelligent,

820
00:58:21,031 --> 00:58:24,134
so I wouldn't say she
completely changed herself.

821
00:58:24,301 --> 00:58:27,071
I'd say she molded
herself to appease them.

822
00:58:27,204 --> 00:58:29,974
But I think she's always
combating with being

823
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:31,842
a second choice for people.

824
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:34,478
So when she meets the coven
and all these vampires

825
00:58:34,645 --> 00:58:36,213
are accepting her
into the coven,

826
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:38,549
she is fulfilled,

827
00:58:38,716 --> 00:58:41,151
and she's found what
she's been looking for...

828
00:58:41,318 --> 00:58:44,188
a group of people
that put her first.

829
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:47,324
To finally be in the coven,

830
00:58:47,491 --> 00:58:49,259
have an opportunity
to go on stage,

831
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:51,161
but to have to play a baby

832
00:58:51,328 --> 00:58:53,998
just reinforces
all of the issues

833
00:58:54,164 --> 00:58:56,867
that she has about
being taken seriously,

834
00:58:57,001 --> 00:58:58,869
being respected.

835
00:58:59,003 --> 00:59:01,371
You'll be their little
birdy for the next 50 years.

836
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:04,675
Being able to make
proactive decisions

837
00:59:04,842 --> 00:59:06,076
about her own life,

838
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:07,520
it's a void that's
created for her

839
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:09,013
that she can never have that.

840
00:59:09,179 --> 00:59:11,515
Shall we have a walk?

841
00:59:11,682 --> 00:59:12,693
For all intents and purposes,

842
00:59:12,717 --> 00:59:15,753
Armand is going to kill Louis.

843
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,455
I don't think it was
preempted that he might not,

844
00:59:18,656 --> 00:59:20,524
because he feels
he has no choice.

845
00:59:20,691 --> 00:59:22,727
His 200 years with the coven

846
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:24,629
is a lot more important
than this new person

847
00:59:24,829 --> 00:59:27,364
who's coming to his life,
even though this person is...

848
00:59:27,531 --> 00:59:32,269
magnetic and making him feel
all these amazing new emotions.

849
00:59:32,436 --> 00:59:34,639
I will not harm you.
Jacob: Louis's in shock...

850
00:59:34,772 --> 00:59:36,092
Those were your
first words to me.

851
00:59:36,173 --> 00:59:37,574
In that moment.

852
00:59:37,742 --> 00:59:39,644
And so, they share
a bit of their past

853
00:59:39,844 --> 00:59:41,245
and a bit of their trauma.

854
00:59:41,378 --> 00:59:42,446
What is it, Louis?

855
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:43,981
I think the cogs are turning.

856
00:59:44,181 --> 00:59:45,549
Those who are the
most powerful...

857
00:59:45,716 --> 00:59:47,051
Their power dynamic.

858
00:59:47,217 --> 00:59:49,553
They're often the weakest.

859
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:51,722
You want to come upstairs?

860
00:59:51,856 --> 00:59:54,558
He doesn't have a way out
in the end, he chooses.

861
00:59:54,725 --> 00:59:56,727
Are you inviting me in?

862
00:59:56,894 --> 00:59:59,129
The choice in the end is...

863
00:59:59,263 --> 01:00:00,898
Depends. To pursue love...

864
01:00:01,065 --> 01:00:02,166
Are you gonna kill me?

865
01:00:02,366 --> 01:00:04,802
To pursue this feeling.
